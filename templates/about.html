    <h1>How this tool works</h1>
    <p>The Theorizr uses a bag-of-words approach to classifying texts. 
    What this means is that it looks at what you've written and tries to gues which critical theorist is 
    likeliest to have written it. The data it looks at to make a decision is what 
    <em>words</em> you used, and with what <em>frequency</em>. 
    It compares your word usage patterns to those of the critical 
    theorists in the database.</p>
<p>The math behind this classification is a support-vector machine, which is quite complicated. 
You can read about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Wikipedia</a>, 
and it boils down to mapping the features of various texts in such a way that they are divided 
into clear groups (in this case, different authors). Then it assesses a new text (yours) 
and sees where on the map it lands.</p>
    
    <h1>How the authors speak</h1>
    
    <p>Each author has some words that identify them most strongly â€“ i.e. when we encounter that word, they are the first author
    in our training set that we think of. Here are the top such words for each theorist in our training data:</p>
    
    {% for line in top_words %}
    <p>{{line}}</p>
    {% endfor %}
<p>&nbsp;</p>
